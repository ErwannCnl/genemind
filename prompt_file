I have a list of genes identified from mutational analysis in [cancer type, e.g. glioblastoma]. These genes were found to be significantly more mutated than expected by chance. Please generate a structured report with the following elements:

## Gene-specific features (for each gene):
- Gene name
- Chromosome/location/plasmid â†’ database retrieval for consistency
- Normal biological function
- Disease implications
- Cellular compartments
- Interactors (if any)

## Context-specific features (specific to [cancer type]):
- Which of the listed genes are most commonly implicated in this cancer
- Known biological pathways or hallmarks of this cancer subtype that these genes converge on
- Evidence from TCGA, COSMIC, or other large-scale cancer studies

## Overall collection-wide insights:
- Common functional themes across the gene set (e.g., DNA repair, cell cycle, receptor signaling)
- Implications for tumor biology in [cancer type]
- Potential biomarkers for classification, prognosis, or therapy
- Broader significance: how these mutations may reshape current understanding of the disease


The output should be structured with clear headings for each gene, followed by sections for context-specific insights and an integrated overview of the gene set as a whole. Please keep the language concise, scientific, and suitable for inclusion in a research report."
