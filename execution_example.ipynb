This cytokine is produced by activated macrophages as a proprotein, which is proteolytically processed to its active form by caspase 1 (CASP1/ICE). This cytokine is an important mediator of the inflammatory response, and is involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2/COX2) by this cytokine in the central nervous system (CNS) is found to contribute to inflammatory pain hypersensitivity. Similarly, IL-1B has been implicated in human osteoarthritis pathogenesis. Patients with severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) present elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid samples. The lung damage induced by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is to a large extent, a result of the inflammatory response promoted by cytokines such as IL-1B. This gene and eight other interleukin 1 family genes form a cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 2.

TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. In silico studies have found a particularly strong binding of surface TLR4 with the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This receptor has also been implicated in signal transduction events induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in most gram-negative bacteria. Mutations in this gene have been associated with differences in LPS responsiveness, and with susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. This protein is a cell-surface protein that can form heterodimers with other TLR family members to recognize conserved molecules derived from microorganisms known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Activation of TLRs by PAMPs leads to an up-regulation of signaling pathways to modulate the host's inflammatory response. This gene is also thought to promote apoptosis in response to bacterial lipoproteins. This gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
